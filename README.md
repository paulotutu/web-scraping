## General info
This project was envisioned to help my fellows at www.centralxbox.com.br, the biggest latin american non-official Xbox website. They dedicate themselves to post news, reviews and anything else related to all Microsoft consoles 24/7.
The need for regular and up to date information about deals and discounts motivated me to build them a spider that go through Microsoft Store and collects all games/dlcs/add-ons that are on sale and export it to a spreedsheet, so they can upload into their website and benefit all their viewers with fresh and sweet deals.

## Technologies
* Python - version 3.8.4

## Setup
* Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/)
* Pip (can be installed with Python or follow instructions at https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

## Features
Ready:
* Get ALL the games/dlcs/add-ons/etc on sales/discounts
* Export the results in spreedsheet format (.xlsx)
* Self install libraries if needed/missing. (last update!)

To-do list:
* Get images
* Add follow-up outputs during the process 
* Option to export to a database for further analyses

## Status
